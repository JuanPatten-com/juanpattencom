  <h2><a href="/blog/reactive-ui-part-1">Let's Build a Reactive UI Framework &ndash; Part 1: Data Flow</a></h2>

  <p>Reactive dataflow libraries like <a href="https://docs.solidjs.com">Solid</a> and <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">MobX</a> are
  a joy to use. They can feel like magic in the same way a spreadsheet
  feels like magic. Change one value and watch the effects ripple through
  the UI.</p>

  <p>The cool thing is that the concepts behind them are actually pretty
  simple! In this series of articles, I want to see if we can distill the
  reactive dataflow paradigm down to its essence, and implement it in
  a straightforward, readable way while still being correct
  (&#8220;glitch-free&#8221; as they say) and performant enough to build
  real apps.</p>
